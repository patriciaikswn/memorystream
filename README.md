MemoryStream is a Python program designed to optimize memory usage on Windows systems in order to improve application performance and system stability. It achieves this by managing memory usage across system processes and freeing up unused resources.

## Features

- Monitors system memory load.
- Frees up standby memory.
- Reduces memory usage of all processes.
- Provides periodic memory status updates.

## Requirements

- Windows operating system.
- Python 3.x.
- Required Python packages: `psutil`

   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
